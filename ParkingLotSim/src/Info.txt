This parking lot program is designed to simulate a parking lot taking in and processing cars.
The ParkingLot class is the main hub for all of the other type objects that exist in the program except for the parker.
The simulation starts in the main method of the ParkingLotDemo by generating ten random Car and Parker objects (with randomly generated expected parking time) and entering them into the ParkingLot object.  The ParkingLot is designed with the Decorator Pattern, as it consists of Level aggregates that take the driver to the following Level to park and the previous Level to exit after it has completed parking.  The main level of the parking lot is the Entrance, which holds a TicketMachine and BillingMachine object to set the Parker with an appropriate Ticket as they are entering and exiting the Entrance.  The two machines interact with a Server object which helps to generate tickets and stores a list of generated tickets as well an available ParkingLocation list (object with floor and parking space).  Two additional data structures are the queue that takes cars entering the parking lot and the arrays that hold Car objects on the ParkingLevels.
